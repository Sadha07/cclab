Step 1: Configure the OpenNebula Repositories
> apt-get update
>echo"deb[signedby=/etc/apt/keyrings/opennebula.gpg]https://<token>@enterprise.open
nebula.io/repo/6.10/Ubuntu/22.04 stable opennebula" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opennebula.list
Step 2: Now install the required packages and ensure that the the keys are downloaded
> apt-get update
>apt-get -y install gnupg wget apt-transport-https
> sudo wget -q -O- https://downloads.opennebula.io/repo/repo2.key | gpg --dearmor --yes 
--output /etc/apt/keyrings/opennebula.gpg
Step 3: Now Download OpenNebula
>echo"deb[signedby=/etc/apt/keyrings/opennebula.gpg]https://downloads.opennebula.io/
repo/6.10/Ubuntu/22.04 stable opennebula" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opennebula.list
Step 4: Now Install OpenNebula
> apt-get update
> apt-get -y install opennebula opennebula-fireedge opennebula-gate opennebula-flow 
opennebula-provision
Step 5: Log in to your MySQL server and issue the following commands while replacing the 
default password with your own secure password:
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. [...]
mysql> CREATE USER 'oneadmin' IDENTIFIED BY '<default password>';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON opennebula.* TO 'oneadmin';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Step 6: Set the database Back-end and connection details in the configuration 
file /etc/one/oned.conf as follows:
DB = [BACKEND = "mysql",
 SERVER = "localhost",
 PORT = 0,
 USER = "oneadmin",
 PASSWD = "<the password>",
 DB_NAME = "opennebula",
 CONNECTIONS = 25,
 COMPARE_BINARY = “no”]
Step 7: Open Nebula’s initial deployment on first usage creates a user oneadmin inside the 
OpenNebula based on a randomly generated password read from /var/lib/one/.one/one_auth. To 
set your own user password from the very beginning, log in as the oneadmin system user with 
this command:
> sudo -u oneadmin /bin/sh
Step 8: Create file /var/lib/one/.one/one_auth with initial password in the format 
oneadmin:<password>
> echo 'oneadmin: changeme123' > /var/lib/one/.one/one_auth
Step 9: Start OpenNebula Services
> systemctl start opennebula opennebula-fireedge opennebula-gate opennebula-flow
Step 10: Enable OpenNebula Services
> systemctl enable opennebula opennebula-fireedge opennebula-gate opennebula-flow
Step 11: Verify Installation
> oneuser show
Step 12: Log in through the Sunstone GUI and Provision GUI.
